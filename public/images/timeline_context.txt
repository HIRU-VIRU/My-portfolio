 Hack Hustle 2024 hosted by Tech Society from Saveetha SEC , a thrilling 24-hour hackathon based on Machine Learning, and what an experience it was! 🖥️💡

Our project aimed to revolutionize public transportation with an AI-driven scheduler and optimizer. Working with an amazing team—Nijeesh NJ & Myself who shaped our USP, Gautham Krishna who developed the robust ML model, and Kishore B who created the web platform to host it—we embarked on a journey of relentless innovation and problem-solving. 🌐🚌

Facing challenges like staying up all night and fetching our dataset in the wee hours, we powered through using ML algorithms such as Networkx, gradient boosting, and several other models and simulation tools. The midnight DJ hour was a memorable highlight that kept our spirits high!
